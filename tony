so I was just introduced to Tony Robbins via the Tim Ferris podcast <link>. Tim quotes and talks highly of him. I like Tim, his life philosophy 
resonates with my own. So if Tim likes tony, then i should at least give him a looksy. So that I did. I stumbled across him on Netflix
with his "I'm not your Guru" documentary. I didn't know Tony was a life/self/performance/insert-thing coach. Normally I pass on 
these because 1) the coaches remind me of used cars salemen if used cars salesmen were to escape from hell and invoke the power of 
satan on earth 2) i can't relate with people so I prematurely judge them based on their need for attention and whining to a point that
i'm personally ashamed that i can view others in such awful light. so after watching the documentary of tony i actually really was
interested to hear more about what he has to say. I don't particulary feel like I need his advice, of which probably means I need it, but
i believe he has tapped into something of the human psych. Its one of those things that i find highly interesting and nervously cautious.
He is on to the fact that we allow our "situations" to control our "actions". Let's not woo this up. Disclaimer. I'm a Christ follower and
devotely believe in the holy trinity. This doesn't however mean that I don't think that others can be on to true or good things. Theirs
many good teachings in other philosophies and religions. End Discliamer. The reason i find this dangerous, not so much with tony but
in general, is because people that are hurting are vulnerable and in my opinion quite gulable. Their looking for hope. This leaves them 
open to snake oil, false prophets, political lies, etc etc. This isn't a rant about that though. Back to Tony. He asks 4 main questions
that he uses as a compass to start navigating the oceans of those seeking his aide. Question 1: Which parent did you crave love from the 
most. **Note** Not which one did you love the most but which one did you **Crave** the most. Question 2: What did you **Feel** you had to 
do to earn that parents love. Question 3: How has that affected your life. Question 4: What happens when you don't achieve
those ideas or goals. (or something like that, i remember the first 2 better)
Off the cuff I thought these were shitty questions. So lets take my 'trust no one' scully hat off and put
on my 'the truth is out there' fox hat on. Watch the vidz or listen to the podcasts for some examples. 
  So question 1. Whose love did I crave the most. For me since I grew up until I was 18 not really having a relationship with my father 
  it was his. 
Question 2. What did you feel you had to do to earn that parents love. For me it was become a warrior. Be stoic. Fearless. Destroyer
of worlds. Slayer of men. Alpha Alpha male.
Question 3. How has that affected your life. hmmm. Well I dominate in everything I do. Relationships, work, Military, education. 
You name it and I feel like i can destroy any competition, any barrier. This seems to be a good thing to me (and he gets to it later).
Question 4. What happens when you don't achieve those ideas or goals. I get confused. Depressed. Anxiety. Lost. 

There is definetely something I want to throw up right here before I go further. This is why I feel that this kind of thing is dangerous.
I whole heartedly believe Tony wants to help people. But according to my belief system there is only one type of savior for our 
souls. And pointing the source of power inward creates a contradiction to my belief system. THATS OK THOUGH. We can still continue
the excercise. I strongly dislike that people have such little conviction in their beliefs that they can't stomach listening to someone
who doesn't agree with them 100%. Who wants that kind of world? Yes men all the time. WEAK SHEEP thats who. 

Now that that is out of the way. Doing Tonys 4 little questions actually gave me some inner insight into myself who I thought
I already intimately knew. And here is why I like TONY. He's not trying to fix/change/blah blah blah people. He's trying to wake
them up that they are who they are not because of their world views. And he "says" he wants to enlighten them so they can choose
and understand why they feel some way. Or if they make bad choices why they make bad choices. Just come to a realization that shit 
happens. And that shit is what makes you who you are. The good and the bad. Whether your Hindu, Christian, Muslim, Aethist, Shinto, etc
you are who you are because of your world view. Unless you were brainwashed (which I've still yet to come across). Those dudes get a free
pass. Not their fault. Everyone else needs to own it. Stop blaming. Start thanking. No one owes you a damn thing. If you have 1 friend
in the whole world and his name is Bob the dog, then you are 1 friend ahead of some people. Gratitude is lost on the complacent in my 
opinion. 

And this isn't to say bad shit doesn't happen. I'll blog on that later. But I can testify that every time something bad happened to me
I personally was 1) Not following biblical teachings 2) literally asking to get into trouble. If I was to say this is the rule and 
all exceptions are moot, I would not only be a liar but in denial. 

Now that I've started pondering this I try to view how will I shape my children. Will I be their Achilles heel? I pray to my Lord that 
I wont be. Parenting is hard. I'm literally always weight the options between not fucking them up and not raising them to be victims. 
Tough line to walk. Well here's the ramblings of a sorry human being that wants to get better. And never forget, Jesus loves you.
